# CSI-2999 Habit-Tracker Project

## Description
- A habit tracker that is focused on simple and minimal design. Emphasis is placed on the trajectory of your habits as opposed to missing a few habits over the course of a week. The tracker will have motivational quotes tailor-made to your specific userâ€™s progress to provide a level of external encouragement in tracking progress. The focus of our habit tracker design is showing that the most important part of habits is being better than you were yesterday, by recommending a short note on how you are feeling before starting your habit journey. You are 42 percent more likely to achieve your goals if you write them down.
